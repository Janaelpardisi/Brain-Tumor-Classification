🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify brain MRI images as either Normal or Tumor.
Early and accurate detection of brain tumors is critical for medical diagnosis, and this model aims to assist in that process through automated image classification.



✅ Project Highlights:

🧪 Objective: Classify MRI images into:

Tumor

Normal


🧠 Model: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained from scratch (or optionally using a pre-trained model like VGG16 or MobileNet).

🧾 Dataset: Brain MRI dataset from [Kaggle or source you used].

📈 Accuracy Achieved: 98% on the test set.

🎯 Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.




🔧 Technologies Used:

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook or VS Code




🧹 Preprocessing Steps:

Image resizing

Grayscale / RGB conversion

Normalization

Data augmentation (optional)




📊 Model Training:

Trained with optimized hyperparameters

Validation used to monitor overfitting

Achieved high accuracy and generalization




🌍 Application Areas:

Automated tumor screening

Medical diagnosis assistance

Deep learning in radiology and healthcare




📌 Future Enhancements:

Multi-class classification (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor)

Real-time deployment using Flask or Streamlit

Integration with hospital imaging systems
